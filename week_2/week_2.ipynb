    "## Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Regression is one of the basic ML tasks. We wish to predict a continuous value for a sample by using sample features. The regression model is a mapping function $f: \\mathbb{R}^M \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$, where $M$ is the dimensionality of the sample, i.e. the number of sample features. E.g. we might use different house features (such as its living area, age, number of bedrooms etc.) for predicting its price on the market. Function $f$ is used to approximate the real data generation process, in this case a market that sets the prices for the houses according to various criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, we assume we have a dataset of samples, where each sample $i$ has features $\\mathbf{x}^{(i)}$ and a true value of predicted variable $y^{(i)}$. Our goal is to create the function $f$, such as $f(\\mathbf{x}^{(i)}) \\approx y^{(i)}$ even for samples the model has not seen before.\n",

    "### Definition of Linear Regression\n",

    "__Notation Reminder:__ We use bold for vectors. $\\mathbf{x}$ is a vector and $x_i$ is the $i$-th component of $\\mathbf{x}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "With linear regression each feature $x_i \\in \\mathbf{x}$ has a weight $w_i$ assigned. The prediction of linear regression model is then a weighted sum:\n",

    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\hat{y}$ is the predicted value (we use $y$ for the true value). Unless we have a perfect regression model, these two will always be different. Apart from feature vector $\\mathbf{x}$, we also introduced weight vector $\\mathbf{w}$ in the equation. Feature vector $\\mathbf{x}^{(i)}$ has different values for each sample $i$, while the weight vector $\\mathbf{w}$ is the same for all the samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we also introduced additional scalar term $b$, called _bias_ in the equation. This is essentially an additional weight that is not dependent on the value of input vector, but is instead applied for each input. In this model $\\mathbf{w}$ and $b$ are considered _parameters_. While $\\mathbf{x}$ and $y$ are given from our dataset, parameters $\\theta = \\{\\mathbf{w}, b\\}$ are variables whose values we do not know. Instead, their optimal value is approximated from the data by a learning process.\n",

    "__E 2.1:__ Artificial neuron is usually defined as $\\sigma(\\textbf{w}\\cdot\\textbf{x} + b)$. Compared to linear regression there is an additional activation function $\\sigma$. We can say that linear regression is a special case of artificial neuron with identity function used for activation $\\sigma(x) = x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "__E 2.2:__ All linear functions of one variable are the family for linear regression. This is not surprising as the definition is the same as the definition for general linear function $f(x) = ax + b$. This inludes all non-vertical lines in the 2D space. With no bias term, we have the family limited only to linear functions that cross the origin $\\textbf{O} = [0, 0]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "__E 2.4:__ All linear functions of two variables are the family here. This includes all the non-vertical planes in the 3D space. Again, with no bias term, all the planes would have to cross the origin point. With bias term we can shift the function surface up or down along the $\\hat{y}$ axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__E 2.7:__ The derivatives are $\\frac{d f}{d x} = 2x$ and $\\frac{d f}{d y} = 2.4y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The update rule is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    " \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "  x_i \\\\ y_i\n",

    "__E 2.8:__ $-2(y^{(i)} - \\hat{y}^{(i)})$\n",
    "\n",
    "__P 2.9.1:__ Return the prediction as: $\\hat{y} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N}{x_i w_i} + b$\n",
    "\n",
    "__P 2.9.2:__ Return tuple with derivative for $\\mathbf{w}$ and $b$. Do not forget that $\\mathbf{w}$ is a vector, not a scalar:\n",
