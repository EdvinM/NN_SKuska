    "# Project\n",
    "\n",
    "You will work in pairs on your deep learning project throughout the semester. In general you are expected to propose your own project, implement a neural network model and perform a series of experiments on it. You are also expected to proactively consult your progress during the labs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Working in pairs\n",
    "__Both students have to put a significant effort into this project.__ The amount of effort put into project by each student will be taken into account during the grading. You will be asked to evaluate your and your partner's effort at the end of the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1st week: Kick-off\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create teams of two people.\n",
    "2. Create a public GitHub repository for your project.\n",
    "3. Register your team to our [projects sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13yO3o9m_vrOiAv0dd2P8GvLBK_Q3quoz_X1uByZ94IY/edit?usp=sharing) (accessible from your G Suite account) along with the GitHub link.\n",
    "4. Start thinking about your project proposal.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5th week: Proposal [5 pts]\n",
    "\n",
    "By 5th week you are expected to submit your project proposal. This proposal needs to be consulted with your teacher during the first 4 weeks. You can use either Slovak or English.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your project will consist of _(1)_ implementing a neural network model, _(2)_ training it with data and _(3)_ evaluating the results from the experiments with this model. It is your task to propose what exactly will your model do, i.e. whether it will be a model capable of translating text, a computer vision model classifying dogs, a speech-to-text model or something completely different. For these _applied_ projects we expect you to work with non-trivial data modalities, such as text, images, sound, etc. You can also instead work on more _basic research_ project and experiment with novel learning algorithms and techniques. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you solve/d similar project elsewhere (e.g. project for different course, team project, master thesis), you need to acknowledge this overlap beforehand. You can not submit the same work more than one time. Instead we will probably ask you to expand on the existing work.\n",
    "\n",
    "We do not recommend _reinforcement learning_ projects, i.e. projects when you train your own agent to play a game. These models are notoriously hard to train and their training might take significant time. Very simple toy games might be an exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inspiration\n",
    "\n",
    "There are tons of interesting websites, blogs, newsletters and twitter accounts about neural networks. Use them to find inspiration for your project. Students at Stanford have their _Deep Learning_ projects [online](https://cs230.stanford.edu/past-projects/), see what they are up to. [PaperWithCode](https://paperswithcode.com/sota) is a repository of academic papers, see what tasks are solved there. _FirmAI_ has repositories of interesting [business](https://github.com/firmai/business-machine-learning) and [industry](https://github.com/firmai/industry-machine-learning) applications of machine learning. However not all of these are well suited for deep learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Submission\n",
    "\n",
    "Submit your proposal as a Markdown file or a Jupyter notebook containing following parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. _Motivation_ - What task will you solve, why is this task important, what are the open questions.\n",
    "2. _Related Work_ - Shortly describe how were similar problems solved by other people.\n",
    "3. _Datasets_ - What datasets exist that can be used to train the task, how much data is available, what are the properties of these data.\n",
    "4. _High-Level Solution Proposal_ - If you know already, what will be the architecture of the model, what experiments would you like to perform.\n",
    "\n",
    "This document should be versioned on your GitHub and submitted to AIS before the deadline.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9th/10th week: Checkpoint [5pts]\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the checkpoint that makes sure that you are on right track with your project. At this point we expect two things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. _Data analysis:_ A Jupyter notebook containing a rudimentary analysis of your data. What is the distribution of features and/or labels? Are there any correlations between features and/or labels? Other similar questions. The notebook should be in a presentable form.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. _Neural network implementation:_ An implementation of your baseline neural model that is able to train. You should also provide a documentation of the architecture of this model.\n",
    "\n",
    "We expect you to consult the expected scope of data analysis as well as the neural architecture with your teacher. Both documents and the code should be versioned on your GitHub and submitted to AIS before the deadline.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 11th/12th week: Final submission [30 pts]\n",
    "\n",
    "In your final submission you should perform a series of experiments using the neural network (and possibly its variants) you implemented previously. We will be using _Google Cloud Platform_ for training with GPUs. The scope of the experiments should be consulted with your teacher. You should submit a document describing the whole project, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Updated motivation and related work sections from the proposal.\n",
    "- Dataset and data analysis from the previous submissions.\n",
    "- Description of the neural model architecture.\n",
    "- Description of the training routine.\n",
    "- Description of the experiments you conducted.\n",
    "- The results of these experiments and their analysis."
