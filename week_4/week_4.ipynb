    "TensorFlow (TF) is a state-of-the-art framework for neural network development, training and deployment. Practically no one implement the neural network models from scratch anymore, because:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The building blocks, such as different kinds of layers, loss function, optimization algorithms, etc. are quite standardized and we mostly use the same blocks over and over again. From this point of view neural networks today can actually be built from existing blocks. Frameworks, such as TF, offer these building blocks so you do not have to implement them from scratch.\n",
    "2. Modern frameworks are also able of auto-differentiation. We do not have to calculate the derivatives of the loss function w.r.t. parameters. Instead these quantities are derived automatically.\n",
    "3. Additional stuff - visualization, training loops, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use TensorFlow 2.0 in this notebook. This version of TF provides several ways of how we define the models, so called APIs. We will use _model subclassing_ API here and in future labs. TF also has two other APIs for model definition [sequential model](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras#sequential_model) and [low-level API](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/low_level_intro) and subclassing - we use functional. You do not have to know how these APIs work, but you are encouraged to read about them to have a general intuition of what TF has to offer."
