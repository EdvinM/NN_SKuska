    "__Goals for this week__\n",
    "\n",
    "We will talk about the organization of this course, including the project you will be working on during this semester. We will go through the prerequisites of this course, i.e. several topics you should know before we can proceed further with our neural networks study.\n",
    "\n",
    "__How to solve this lab?__\n",
    "\n",
    "Just follow this notebook and run all the code cells. Correct answers for some exercises are provided at the bottom.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Course Information\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Programming assignments [10 pts]:__ Some labs will have short Python programming assignments. Each will be worth 2 points. You are expected to complete these assignments in one week and submit your code.\n",
    "- __Project [40 pts]:__ You will work in pairs on a deep learning project throughout the entire semester. You are expected to consult your progress during the labs and present your solution at the end of semester. \n",
    "- __Exam [50 pts]__\n",
    "\n",
    "Please check the [Project](../project/project.ipynb) page _right now_ for more information about how to proceed with your project from now on.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feedback\n",
    "\n",
    "- Please use [Askalot](https://askalot.fiit.stuba.sk/fiit/) for all the questions that might be interesting for other students. You can also use it as a general discussion board for this course.\n",
    "- You can fill our [questionnaire]() after each lab. This questionnaire gives us information about what the students struggle with during this course.\n",
    "- These notebooks are a work in progress. If you notice a mistake, notify us, raise an issue or make a pull request on [GitHub](https://github.com/matus-pikuliak/neural_networks_at_fiit).\n",
    " \n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Prerequisites are topics that you should already be familiar with from your previous study. If you have troubles with some of them, you should review them during this week.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use _Python 3.6_ in our labs. We assume that you have seen Python code before. If you have not, you should learn the basics as soon as possible (e.g. [W3Schools tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp))). We review the basic concepts in the scripts below. You should understand it fully, otherwise review your knowledge before you proceed."
